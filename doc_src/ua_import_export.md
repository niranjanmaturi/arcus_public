# Importing/Exporting

Both Templates and Device Types can be exported from one Arcus installation and imported into another installation. This can be used to transfer common configuration between installations or to receive new WWT-distributed configuration.

## Importing

The processes for importing a template or device type bundle are very similar but are presented separately for clarity:

#### Importing a Template Bundle

1. Log into the Arcus instance that you wish to import Templates into.
2. Click on 'Templates' in the sidebar
3. Click on the 'Import from JSON' button at the top of the screen
4. Use the file selector to choose the file containing the Template bundle you wish to upload.
5. Click 'Submit Json file'
6. If there are errors with any Template, you will receive a list of error messages for the bundle. Only if all Templates are valid will the import succeed.

#### Importing a Device Type Bundle

1. Log into the Arcus instance that you wish to import Device Types into.
2. Click on 'Device Types' in the sidebar
3. Click on the 'Import from JSON' button at the top of the screen
4. Use the file selector to choose the file containing the Device Type bundle you wish to upload.
5. Click 'Submit Json file'
6. If there are errors with any Device Type, you will receive a list of error messages for the bundle. Only if all Device Types are valid will the import succeed.
